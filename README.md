### Setup Notes

You will need to have `wsl 2` installed and docker desktop needs to be configured to run for whatever linux distro you are using.

`docker-compose up` from linux prompt will start the containers and you are good to work.

### TODO
 - [ ] Add theme files and enqueue them
 - [ ] Get together basic templates for the site: site-home-page.php, single.php, front-page.
